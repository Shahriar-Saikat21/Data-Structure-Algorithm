# Data-Structure-Algorithm
Here I have coded some important Data Structure and Algorithm implimentation for study purpose

Data Structure :
Array
Linked List - Single, Double, Circular
Stack
Queue
Priority Queue
Heap - Max & Min
Disjoint Set
Tree
Binary Search Tree
Graph

Algorithm :
Sorting - Bubble, Selection, Insertion,Counting,Merge, Quick
Search - Linear, Binary
Graph and Tree Traversal - BFS, DFS
